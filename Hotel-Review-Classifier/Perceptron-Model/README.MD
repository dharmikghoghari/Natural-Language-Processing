The model was develoepd on the principles of Perceptorn Algorithm.
Two flavors of the algorithm were implemented, Vanilla Perceptron and Averaged Perceptron. 
The model's accuracy was improved by using a list of stop words. 
The model was trained and tested on the Deceptive Opinion Spam Corpus v1.4(licensed under the Creative Commons).

Accuracy of the Vanilla Perceptron model: 90.4%
Accuracy of the Averaged Perceptron model: 90.6%
Run time: 1.5 seconds (includes training on 960 reviews and classifying 320 reviews)
