<h1> Perceptron Model </h1><br>

The model was develoepd on the principles of <b>Perceptorn Algorithm</b>.<br>
Two flavors of the algorithm were implemented, Vanilla Perceptron and Averaged Perceptron.<br>
The model's accuracy was improved by using a list of stop words.<br> 
The model was trained and tested on the Deceptive Opinion Spam Corpus v1.4(licensed under the Creative Commons).<br>

The below results were obtained when model was trained on 1280 reviews and the model was used to classify 320 reviews.<br>

Vanilla Perceptron Model <br>
Accuracy: 87.812%<br>
F1 Score: 87.812% <br>

Averaged Perceptron Model<br>
Accuracy: 88.281%<br>
F1 Score: 88.281%<br>

Run time: 2.2 seconds (includes training on 1280 reviews and classifying 320 reviews for both the vanilla and averaged model)
